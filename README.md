# Lottery Cash Register (Midterm)

## Objective
To develop a Cash Register System, using React.js, that is designed to function within a fictional lottery system called “WHE WHE”. It will allow a cashier to generate a customer’s ticket, i.e, select 5 numbers and assign a money value to it.

In the realm of “WHE WHE”, to participate, a customer MUST choose 5 numbers and then assign a money value to their ticket. The more money a customer attaches to their ticket, the higher their pay out would be if their 5 selected numbers are drawn.
